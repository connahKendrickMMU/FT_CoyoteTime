# FT_CoyoteTime
In this focus topic you will work on a key aspect of the assignment, gameplay iteration and refinement. You'll look a a common place mechanic in platformers, Coyote Time.

## Overview
Try to implement the mechanic using the following hints to adjust the CoyoteTime Character scripts:
You will need to rebind input in C++, implement 3 functions and add a tick function
## Where to find the relevant scripts

## Task
- Implement Coyote Time into the character movement system, allowing the character a slight buffer to jump while falling.

## Changes from base project

## Challenges

This is one our oddest challenges, most of our tasks is around researching theory and implementation of a game design concepts and the key phrases "Gameplay Iteration", "Gameplay Refinement" and "Gameplay Juice". This is more then just making a machanic, it about making a mechanic that players enjoy using without even realising it. - **add bender if you do things right, QUOTE IF THE VIDEO ISNT AVAILABLE**

MORTAL KOMBAT!

### Easy
- For most this is a newer concept, however, games have a array refinements. Look into these, as well as other game refinements, such as the "Rule of 40 Seconds", "Recognition over Recall" and "Juice/ Feel". 
- See a video videos from [Game Juice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg) on it, look at how packages, like [Feel by More Mountains](https://feel.moremountains.com/) for Unity build on these concepts.
- Watch in how they made a [Button](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1B5YaxxoA) more fun.

### Medium
- Coyote time expands just jumping, in [An Elaborate History of Chess](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255020/An_Elaborate_History_of_Chess/) It is used on the GUI to allow selection when pieces are moving. See where else you can use it in your game.
- Look at the game [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/) they make precise changes to jump frames such as the jumping up vs drop, for precise gameplay design.


### Hard - Your turn
- Focus on what mechanic you want to develop.
- How can you refine and iterate on that mechanic.
- Talk with me, the helpers and all of your colleauges and friends on your idea and how to refine it.
